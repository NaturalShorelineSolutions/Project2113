                        <h2>Project Description</h2>
                        <p class="lead">There has been a significant gap in current, reliable landscape and parcel-based information that has been required for the planning and implementation of protection efforts of ecosystems around Clear and Stoney Lake, Ontario.</p>
						<p class="lead">As a result, the progress to protect and conserve biologically important land by our clients, the Environment Council for Clear, Ston(e)y, and White Lakes and the Kawartha Land Trust, has been impeded. </p>
						<p class="lead">To aid in the implementation of conservation initiatives by the clients, two deliverables were created. The first deliverable was a Digitization Manual detailing methodology for shoreline inventory on Stoney and Clear Lakes. The second was a mapping application containing information on the shorefront parcels and their viability for conservation and protection. Viability was determined based on criteria identified in collaboration with the clients, which assessed the effect of building footprint, wetland, watercourse, ecosystem connectivity features and shoreline alteration.</p>
						<p class="lead">This project has provided our clients with up-to-date data and comprehensive mapping that will significantly aid in the protection efforts for Clear and Stoney Lakes as well as future studies in the region.</p>

                        <p class="lead-2">To meet the objectives set by the clients, our methodology was split into data acquisition, shoreline inventory, and parcel analysis.</p>

						<h4 class="mb-3-white">Data Acquisition</h4>
						<p class="lead-2">To provide the clients with current and reliable data on Stoney and Clear Lake, criteria to assess the state of shorefront parcels was identified. This criteria included building density, presence of ecosystem connectivity features, presence of wetland/watercourse habitat, and shoreline features. Data for the first three criteria were acquired through public servers, such as Ontario GeoHub, as well as through private, community connections with Peterborough County and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. To ensure accuracy and where required update the existing data, 2018 aerial imagery was used. The final criteria, shoreline information was non-existent, and required further processing to acquire.</p>

						<h4 class="mb-3-white">Shoreline Inventory</h4>
						<p class="lead-2 mb-5">To acquire shoreline inventory information, classification methodology was created following Best Practices established by the OMNRF. A pilot project for shoreline digitization was conducted using these classifications. In total 22.7km of the total 117km of shorelines were digitized. Data was digitized using 2018 aerial imagery and validated using field-collected data.  </p>

						<h4 class="mb-3-white">Parcel Analysis</h4>
						<p class="lead-2">Following data acquisition, a parcel analysis was preformed to identify suitable parcels for conservation. Parcels were assessed for suitability for each criterion as high, medium, or low suitability. The results of the suitability for each criterion were then combined to create the final surface featured.</p>
